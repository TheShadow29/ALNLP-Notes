# ALNLP-Notes
A few experiments with [allennlp](https://allennlp.org/) to understand it better. 

## What is allennlp?
It is a powerful library built on top of pytorch (https://pytorch.org/) mainly for natural language processing. The design is very modular with a very high quality and clean code base. 

## Why this repository?
This repository is to gain better understanding of the library. It took me quite some time to understand why some of the designs were chosen. Some parts were unintuitive. I had to dig through the library a bit to gain some familiarity. This repository is to share my findings in the form of jupyter notebooks. 

# Notebooks:
- [x] Tutorial: Basically the allennlp tutorial explored in detail to understand what each imported module does. 
- [ ] ELMO experiments
- [ ] Bert experiments
